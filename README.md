# pythonCrashCourse

### Description:

This repository is to document my Journey through the book [Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DYFB3YNMGERM&keywords=python+crash+course+2nd+edition&qid=1697603132&sprefix=python+cras%2Caps%2C283&sr=8-1). As I go through each and every chapter I will write code that is being talked about and plan on going back to make improvements as well as add in my own tweaks to aide with learning.
